# Result files
Poirot produces a lot of intermediate and result files but only files defined in [`output_files.json`](https://github.com/clinical-genomics-uppsala/poirot_rd_wgs/blob/main/config/output_list.json) are kept, the rest are temporary and will be deleted when not needed by any other rules in the pipeline. Please use the `--no-temp` snakemake option when running the pipeline to retain all files generated by the pipeline, or edit the output_files.json to retain a retain the files required.


## Files
Successful execution of the pipeline result in the the following output files located in `Results/`-folder:

## MultiQC report
Poirot produces a **[MultiQC](https://github.com/ewels/MultiQC)**-report for the entire sequencing run to enable easier QC tracking. The report starts with a general statistics table showing the most important QC-values followed by additional QC data and diagrams. The entire MultiQC html-file is interactive and you can filter, highlight, hide or export data using the ToolBox at the right edge of the report.

<br />

The report is configured based on a MultiQC config file. 

/// details | Expand to view current MultiQC config.yaml
```yaml
{% include "includes/multiqc_config.yaml" %}
```
///

The report contain qc information derived from the following programs:



### General Statistics
The general statistics table are ordered based on the sample order in Illumina `SampleSheet.csv` file used during sequencing, this is done by renaming the samples in two steps using the script `extract_samples_info.py`. To toggle between "Sample Order" and "Sample Name" use the buttons just above General Stats header.

## Coverage analysis
 It is important to know that the information is actually there when trying to draw clinically relevant conclusions from the data. This is done by a gene coverage analysis which results in an excel file with a tab for each gene panel that is of interest,
